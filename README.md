**Exchange Rate API** Testing with Serenity BDD & Screenplay
This project implements automated API testing for an exchange rate service using Serenity BDD and Screenplay frameworks and Maven.

**Features**:

Verify exchange rate retrieval for a given currency pair.
Ensure response time meets expected performance benchmarks.

**Project Structure:**

src/main/java: Contains Java source code for step definitions and Serenity Screenplay implementations.
src/test/java: Houses the feature files defining test steps & runner.
src/test/resources/features: Houses the feature files defining test scenarios.
pom.xml: Defines project dependencies and build configuration.

**Dependencies:**

Serenity BDD
Serenity REST
Serenity Screenplay

(Optional) Additional libraries based on your specific API interactions (e.g., JSON parsing)
Getting Started:

**Clone the project:** 
Replace "REPOSITORY_URL" with the actual URL for your project repository.

Bash
git clone REPOSITORY_URL
Use code with caution.

**Set up dependencies:** Ensure you have Maven or Gradle installed and run the appropriate command to download dependencies:

**Maven**: mvn clean install
Gradle: ./gradlew build
Configure API Endpoint (Optional): If your feature files reference specific URLs or credentials, update them accordingly based on your testing environment.

**Run Tests:**
Use the following command to execute the tests:

Maven: mvn verify
Gradle: ./gradlew test

**Testing Exchange Rates:**

The provided feature files (details not included due to potential sensitive information) showcase scenarios for testing exchange rate retrieval functionalities.

**Response Time Verification:**

The code implements logic to measure API response times and asserts they meet performance expectations. You can customize these assertions based on your requirements.

**Step Definitions:**

Step definitions translate human-readable steps in the feature files into actual API calls and verification logic using Serenity Screenplay and few more scenarios.

**Serenity Screenplay Implementation:**

The implementation utilizes Serenity Screenplay actors to interact with the API and perform assertions on the responses.

**Developing Your Tests:**

This project provides a foundation for building further API testing scenarios for your exchange rate service. You can extend the feature files and step definitions to cover additional functionalities and edge cases.

**Additional Notes:**

Modify the project structure and dependencies as needed for your specific testing environment and API interactions.
Refer to the Serenity BDD and Screenplay documentation for detailed information on these frameworks and best practices.
Feel free to provide the feature files and step definitions for a more tailored overview. This README provides a general structure for your Serenity BDD & Screenplay project focused on exchange rate API testing.
